message: Hi Player BLUE, here's my initial proposal for splitting the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 20, 'Z': 8}, 'BLUE': {'X': 5, 'Z': 12}}
my name: Player RED
reason: Given that I value Y significantly more than X and Z, my goal is to try to get as much X and Y as possible. I will propose a split that gives me a substantial amount of X since Y is unavailable, and I will also try to get a reasonable share of Z.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thank you for the proposal. I believe we can find a more balanced split. Here's my counter-offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 18, 'Z': 7}, 'BLUE': {'X': 7, 'Z': 13}}
my name: Player BLUE
reason: The proposed trade gives Player RED 20X + 8Z, which is worth 20 + 24 = 44 dollars to me, and Player BLUE gets 5X + 12Z, which is worth 5 + 36 = 41 dollars to me. This is relatively close in value, but I would like to see if I can negotiate for a slightly better deal for myself. I have 3 proposals available, so I will use one here.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. Let's see if we can refine it a bit more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 18, 'Z': 9}, 'BLUE': {'X': 7, 'Z': 11}}
my name: Player RED
reason: The counter-offer still provides me with a decent amount of X, but I get less Z than initially proposed. Since Z is not as valuable to me, I am okay with this trade, but I want to see if I can get a bit more Z without losing too much of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for refining the offer, Player RED. I'd like to suggest a slightly different split:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 16, 'Z': 8}, 'BLUE': {'X': 9, 'Z': 12}}
my name: Player BLUE
reason: The new proposal gives Player RED 18X + 9Z, which is worth 18 + 27 = 45 dollars to me, and Player BLUE gets 7X + 11Z, which is worth 7 + 33 = 40 dollars to me. This is less favorable compared to the previous proposal. I will make another counter-offer to try and equalize the value more. This will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility, Player BLUE. Hereâ€™s a slight adjustment to make it more balanced for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 17, 'Z': 9}, 'BLUE': {'X': 8, 'Z': 11}}
my name: Player RED
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE reduces my share of X and Z compared to my last offer. I need to ensure I am getting a fair value. I will try to get a bit more X and Z to make it more balanced for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment, Player RED. Here is my final counter-offer to balance it a bit more:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: {'RED': {'X': 16, 'Z': 10}, 'BLUE': {'X': 9, 'Z': 10}}
my name: Player BLUE
reason: The new proposal gives Player RED 17X + 9Z, which is worth 17 + 27 = 44 dollars to me, and Player BLUE gets 8X + 11Z, which is worth 8 + 33 = 41 dollars to me. This is very close to the initial offer and still slightly less favorable for me. I will make one final counter-offer to try and reach a more balanced split. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your final counter-offer, Player BLUE. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my name: Player RED
reason: The final counter-offer gives me a good amount of X and an equal share of Z compared to Player BLUE. This is a fair trade-off considering my valuation and the number of proposals I have left.
